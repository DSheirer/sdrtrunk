#summary Description of the map component

= Map =

The map displays any decoded messages that contain location data, like GPS positions.

The map component uses aliases to determine the display label, icon and color to use when plotting decoded messages.  Update messages from the same entity are chained together.

The map uses map tiles from the open street map server.  If you do not have an internet connection, no map data will be displayed, however decoded messages will be plotted.
