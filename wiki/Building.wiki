#summary Details how to checkout the source code and build the sdrtrunk application.

= Downloading and Compiling sdrtrunk =

This page describes several methods for checking out the source code from the SVN server and building the sdrtrunk application on your local computer.

== Eclipse IDE==

If you use the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse IDE for Java], you can download and import the sdrtrunk project directly into Eclipse.

 # Install an eclipse svn plugin ( Help > Install New Software, choose the Luna site, Collaboration > Subversive SVN )
 # Project Explorer > Import > SVN > Project from SVN
 # Create a new repository location: https://sdrtrunk.googlecode.com/svn
 or http://sdrtrunk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
 # Open the ant view ( Window > Show View > Ant )
 # Drag the ant build script from the Package Explorer (sdrtrunk/build/build.xml) into the ant view panel 
 # Click the play button to execute the default build target
 # Compiled software package is placed in the sdrtrunk/product/xxx.zip folder

== Manually ==

 # Install the Java JDK version 1.7 or higher and create a JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to the JDK installation folder
 # Install an SVN client on your computer: [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html Tortoise SVN] on windows or kdesvn on Linux
 # Checkout the source code from https://sdrtrunk.googlecode.com/svn
 or http://sdrtrunk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
 # Install the latest version of [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant] and follow the installation instructions in the [http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html manual]
 # Change to the sdrtrunk build directory ( sdrtrunk/build )
 # Execute the ant command.

Ant will look for a file named build.xml in the current folder and will run the the default build target.  The compiled and zipped output program file will be located in the sdrtrunk/product/xxx.zip folder.
