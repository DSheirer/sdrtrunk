== Tuner Configurations ==

SDRTrunk allows you to define multiple named tuner configurations per tuner type.  A *Default* configuration is automatically created the first time you use each specific tuner type and will be recreated again if you accidentally delete or rename the *Default* configuration.

SDRTrunk uses the serial number from the E4000 that can be set using the rtl_eeprom utility, so automatically associate a named tuner configuration with the E4000 dongle, regardless of which USB port is used. 

All changes to a named configuration are automatically saved.

== Configuration ==

  * *Frequency* - sets the tuned frequency
  * *Configuration Tab* - controls for changing tuner configuration
  * *Info Tab* - displays information about the tuner

=== Configuration Tab ===

  * *Config* - selects a named configuration to use.  Automatically applies the corresponding settings to the tuner
  * *Name* - tuner configuration name.
  * *Correction PPM* - correction value to align the currently tuned frequency with the frequency display values.  Increasing the value causes the frequency display to move to the left and vice-versa.
  * *Sample Rate* - sets the sample rate to use for the tuner.
  * *Master Gain* - sets the overall gain for the tuner and automatically controls the individual gain controls.  Use the *Manual* setting to enable and independently change the LNA, Mixer and Enhance gain controls
  * *LNA Gain* - sets the LNA gain.  Place the Master Gain into *Manual* mode to enable this control.
  * *Mixer Gain* - sets the Mixer gain.  Place the Master Gain into *Manual* mode to enable this control.
  * *Enhance Gain* - sets the Enhance gain.  Place the Master Gain into *Manual* mode to enable this control.
  * *New* - creates a new named tuner configuration
  * *Delete* - deletes the currently listed tuner configuration

=== Info Tab ===
The info tab displays information about the tuner:

  * *USB ID* - USB vendor and product identifiers.
  * *Vendor* - vendor name from EEPROM
  * *Product* - product label from EEPROM
  * *Serial* - serial label from EEPROM
  * *IR Enabled* - IR enabled setting from EEPROM
  * *Remote Wake* - remote wake setting from EEPROM
