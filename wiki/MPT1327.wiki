#summary MPT1327 decoder description

= MPT-1327 =

The MPT-1327 decoder provides decoding of both control and traffic channel signaling.

== Traffic Channels ==

SDRTrunk will create traffic channels dynamically to follow trunked radio calls as they occur.  This feature requires a channel map and an available tuner that can provide the channel's frequency.

SDRTrunk decodes the traffic channel tear down event broadcast at the end of the call on the traffic channel.  If the decoder misses this event, a timer will end the call after 45 seconds.
