=== Tuner Configurations ===

SDRTrunk allows you to define multiple named tuner configurations per tuner type.  A *Default* configuration is automatically created the first time you use each specific tuner type and will be recreated again if you accidentally delete or rename the *Default* configuration.

Each time you plug your USB tuner into a new USB port, it will automatically use the *Default* tuner configuration.  If you select a different named configuration, SDRTrunk will remember to use that named configuration each time you use the USB tuner in that specific USB port.  If you create a named configuration for your tuner and subsequently move the tuner to a different USB port, simply select that named configuration from the drop-down list and it will store that port to named configuration setting.

All changes to a named configuration are automatically saved.

  * *Configuration Selection List* - selects a named configuration to use.  Automatically applies the corresponding settings to the tuner
  * *Name* - tuner configuration name.
  * *Correction Tab - Frequency PPM* - correction value to align the currently tuned frequency with the frequency display values.  Increasing the value causes the frequency display to move to the left and vice-versa.
  * *Correction Tab - DC Inphase* - corrects for DC offset in the Inphase component
  * *Correction Tab - DC Quadrature* - corrects for DC offset in the Quadrature component
  * *Correction Tab - Gain* - corrects for Gain
  * *Correction Tab - Phase* - corrects for Phase
  * *Gain Tab - LNA* - LNA gain setting
  * *Gain Tab - LNA Enahance* - LNA enhance gain setting
  * *Gain Tab - Mixer* - Mixer gain setting
  * *New* - creates a new named tuner configuration
  * *Delete* - deletes the currently listed tuner configuration

=== Info Tab ===
The info tab displays information about the tuner:

  * *USB Address* - current USB bus and device port, and USB vendor and product identifiers.
  * *Cellular Band* - indicates if the cellular band is blocked or unblocked for this tuner
  * *Firmware* - firmware revision

Note: firmware on the www.funcube.com website is identified by a major revision and letter.  Convert the listed firmware minor revision number to a letter to identify the correct firmware revision on the funcube website.
