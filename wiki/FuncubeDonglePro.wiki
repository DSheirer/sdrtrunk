=== Tuner Configurations ===

SDRTrunk allows you to define multiple named tuner configurations per tuner type.  A *Default* configuration is automatically created the first time you use each specific tuner type and will be recreated again if you accidentally delete or rename the *Default* configuration.

Each time you plug your USB tuner into a new USB port, it will automatically use the *Default* tuner configuration.  If you select a different named configuration, SDRTrunk will remember to use that named configuration each time you use the USB tuner in that specific USB port.  If you create a named configuration for your tuner and subsequently move the tuner to a different USB port, simply select that named configuration from the drop-down list and it will store that port to named configuration setting.

All changes to a named configuration are automatically saved.

  * *Configuration Selection List* - selects a named configuration to use.  Automatically applies the corresponding settings to the tuner
