=JMBE Library=

The Java Multi-Band Excitation (JMBE) library provides decoder support for converting IMBE encoded audio frames to normal audio so that you can listen to the audio calls over your computer speakers.

==Patent Warning==

The JMBE library contains source code that may be patent protected.  Users 
should check local laws before downloading, compiling, using, or DISTRIBUTING 
compiled versions of the JMBE library.

==Copyright Notice==

==Adding JMBE to SDRTrunk for decoding MBE audio==

# Download the *jmbe_builder.zip* (windows) or the *jmbe_builder.tar.gz* (linux) file to your computer and uncompress the file.  These files are available in the [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7BHsssXUq8eOHBTNndCczZTd0k&usp=sharing Download] folder

# Run the *make_jmbe_library_windows.bat* (windows) or the *make_jmbe_library_linux.sh* (linux) file.  This will download the source code and create the *jmbe-x.x.x.jar* file.  The file that gets created will have version numbers in place of the x's in the filename.

# Copy the *jmbe-x.x.x.jar* file to the same folder where you run the sdrtrunk scripts to start the sdrtrunk program. 

# Start SDRTrunk normally and the program will automatically discover and use the jmbe library.

==Troubleshooting==

If you download, compile and copy the JMBE library jar file to the same directory as the SDRTrunk application, you should not have any issues.

SDRTrunk will generate a log entry to let you know if it discovered the jmbe library correctly for each P25 channel that you have decoding:

  09:38:54.166 INFO  d.p.audio.P25AudioOutput - JMBE audio conversion library successfully loaded - P25 audio will be available

Or, when the library cannot be found, each channel will log:
  
  09:38:54.166 INFO  d.p.audio.P25AudioOutput - JMBE audio conversion  library NOT FOUND
