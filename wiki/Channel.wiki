== Creating a New Channel ==

== Channel Configuration ==

  * *Enabled* - turns the channel on/off for decoding.
  * *Name* - name for the channel
  * *Aliases* - assigns an AliasList to the channel so that any identifiers produced by the decoder can have an [Alias] value.
  * *Source Tab* - designates the source for raw sampled data to feed the decoder
  * *Decoder Tab* - designates the primary decoder to use for this channel
  * *Aux Tab* - identifies additional auxiliary decoders to use in addition to the primary decoder
  * *Event Log Tab* - logging options for decoded events
  * *Record Tab* - recording options

=== Source Tab ===

The source tab allows you to specify the source for raw sampled data to feed the primary and auxiliary decoders.

  * *No Source* - this is the default source when a new channel is created.  You cannot decode a channel with this source.
  * *Mixer/Sound Card* - allows you to use an external radio scanner with the audio output or discriminator tapped audio from the scanner patched to a sound card input on the computer.  Select the Mixer (Sound Card) and Channel for the sound card where you have the scanner audio patched.
  * *Tuner* - allows you to specify a radio frequency as the source for raw samples.  You must have a [Tuner] attached to your computer and it must appear in the list of [Tuners] in the SDRTrunk [Configuration] window.  If no tuners are attached, or if none of the attached tuners can tune the requested frequency, the channel will indicated 'No Tuner' when you enable it.
