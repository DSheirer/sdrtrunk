#summary Channel

= Channel =

A channel defines all of the configuration details needed for to setup a radio channel for decoding. When a [Channel] is actively decoding, the system icon is colored Green.  If there is no source available, the channel icon turns red.

== Creating a New Channel ==

Right-click on a [Site] folder and select 'New Channel'.

== Deleting a Channel ==

Right-click on the [Channel] and select 'Delete'

== Channel Configuration ==

  * *Enabled* - turns the channel on/off for decoding.
  * *Name* - name for the channel
  * *Aliases* - assigns an AliasList to the channel so that any identifiers produced by the decoder can have an [Alias] value.
  * *Source Tab* - designates the source for raw sampled data to feed the decoder
  * *Decoder Tab* - designates the primary decoder to use for this channel
  * *Aux Tab* - identifies additional auxiliary decoders to use in addition to the primary decoder
  * *Event Log Tab* - logging options for decoded events
  * *Record Tab* - recording options

=== Source Tab ===

The source tab allows you to specify the source for raw sampled data to feed the primary and auxiliary decoders.

  * *No Source* - this is the default source when a new channel is created.  You cannot decode a channel with this source.
  * *Mixer/Sound Card* - allows you to use an external radio scanner with the audio output or discriminator tapped audio from the scanner patched to a sound card input on the computer.  Select the Mixer (Sound Card) and Channel for the sound card where you have the scanner audio patched.
  * *Tuner* - allows you to specify a radio frequency as the source for raw samples.  You must have a [Tuner] attached to your computer and it must appear in the list of [Tuners] in the SDRTrunk [Configuration] window.  If no tuners are attached, or if none of the attached tuners can tune the requested frequency, the channel will indicated 'No Tuner' when you enable it.

=== Decoder Tab ===

The decoder tab provides a list of available primary decoders to select for the channel.  Only one primary decoder can be selected per channel.  If you want to run multiple primary decoders, create additional channels, each with a different primary decoder.

  * *[LTRStandardDecoder LTR-Standard]* - FM demodulator and Logic Trunked Radio (LTR) trunked radio signaling decoder
  * *[LTRNetDecoder LTR-Net]* - FM demodulator and LTR-Net trunked radio signaling decoder
  * *[MPT1327Decoder MPT-1327]* - FM demodulator and MPT-1327 trunked radio signaling decoder.  Provides automatic traffic channel following.
  * *[NBFMDecoder NBFM]* - narrow-band FM demodulator.
  * *[PassportDecoder Passport]* - FM demodulator and Passport trunked radio signaling decoder.
