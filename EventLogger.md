# Event Log #

The event log contains logging information about decoded messages from one of the decoder channels.  Each channel will generate a log file that starts with a time stamp and ends with the channel name and a .log suffix.

Note: see [ApplicationLog](ApplicationLog.md) for details about logging of application information.
