0.3.4 20180418
 - New P25 C4FM decoder that uses Differential QPSK decoder instead of FM demodulation with 4FSK.
 - Adds channel auto-start and ordering capability with startup dialog allowing user to invoke or bypass channel
   auto-start.  Provides user with more control over startup configuration.
 - Adds preferred tuner attribute to channel configuration allowing user to select a preferred tuner for the channel

0.3.3 20171225
 - Changes build system from ant to gradle.  Thanks to: Roman Tsypuk https://github.com/tsypuk
 - Adds LIST and ID3 metadata to wav audio recordings

0.3.2 20171105
 - Resolves issue with tuner frequency adjustments that was causing channel processing
   to lockup and show persistent 'overflow' state in each channel status
 - Resolves issue with broadcastify 'mountpoint-in-use' error handling and updates
   memory usage logging
 - Resolves issue with Shoutcast 2 login error

0.3.1 20171009
 - Resolves Java 9 incompatibility issues

0.3.0 20170922
 - REQUIRES: Java 8 (or newer) for compatibility and eventual changeover to JavaFX
 - FEATURE: audio streaming - adds capability to stream to multiple remote broadcast
   servers (Broadcastify, Icecast v2.3 and v2.4+, and Shoutcast V1 and V2).  Each
   stream can be independently configured with a delay.  Audio calls are directed
   to one or more streams by attaching one or more stream identifiers to each alias.
 - Extensive GUI updates for tuner, channel and alias management.  Includes new
   'Now Playing' channel view and 'Detail' view.
 - Updated alias list management of alias id values and wildcards.  Weighting is now
   applied to each wildcard so that they can be ordered from most specific to least
   specific for lookup value matching purposes.
 - Added handling for Motorola-specific P25 patch messages and auto-generation of
   patch group aliases that roll-up aliases from each patched talkgroup to support
   audio recording and streaming of patch calls according to the identifiers and
   actions defined for each of the patched talkgroups.
 - Implemented bounded queues for both tuner and individual channel IQ sample
   buffers.  Bounded queues have ability to enter/exit overflow state when queue
   size reaches overflow threshold and reset when queue size falls below the reset
   threshold.  Channel state will show OVERFLOW in red/yellow.
 - Improves handling of P25 TDMA channels (NO Phase 2 decoder support yet)
 - Updated airspy controller for airspy-mini specific sample rate handling.
 - New developer remez filter designer tool and internal usage

0.2.0 20160329
 - Major overhaul of underlying processing chain and extensive updates to all 
   decoders and filters
 - New audio playback interface with global mute and support for one or two
   audio channels
 - Audio playback is prioritized using a new Call Priority name action
   with selected channels having the highest priority and any audio without
   an name identifier having the lowest priority.
 - Updated Audio recording per call with new 'Non-Recordable' name action
 - Updated Baseband (I/Q) recording at 48 kHz
 - Added Airspy tuner support
 - New traffic channel pool manager for trunked call following
 - P25 Decoder for C4FM and LSM with trunked call following and audio
   decoding via the JMBE library
 - Updated MPT1327 decoder and trunked call following.
 - Updated spectral and waterfall display with zoom (2-64x) and pan and automatic
   noise floor (dB) adjusted to tuner sample size
 - Resolved some issues with memory leaks and crashes
