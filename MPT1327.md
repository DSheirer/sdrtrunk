# MPT-1327 #

The MPT-1327 decoder provides decoding of both control and traffic channel signaling.

## Squelch Control ##

The control channel is not squelch controlled and will produce audio of the control signal when selected.  Each individual traffic channel is unsquelched for the duration of the call, until call end, or call timeout.

## Usage ##
Run the decoder against the control channel.  If a tuner is available, traffic channels will be created and started decoding automatically.  Upon call tear down, or call timeout, traffic channels will automatically be destroyed.

NOTE: the decoder requires a [channel map](ChannelMap.md) in order to automatically allocate and trunk track traffic channels.

Monitor the messages window to verify that the decoder is working.  Ensure the tuner is accurately aligned with the center of the control signal for optimal decoding.
