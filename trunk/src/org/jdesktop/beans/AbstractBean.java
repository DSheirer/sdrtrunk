/**
 * <p>
 * A convenience class from which to extend all non-visual AbstractBeans. It
 * manages the PropertyChange notification system, making it relatively trivial
 * to add support for property change events in getters/setters.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A non-visual java bean is a Java class that conforms to the AbstractBean
 * patterns to allow visual manipulation of the bean's properties and event
 * handlers at design-time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here is a simple example bean that contains one property, foo, and the proper
 * pattern for implementing property change notification:
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * public class ABean extends AbstractBean {
 *     private String foo;
 * 
 *     public void setFoo(String newFoo) {
 *         String old = getFoo();
 *         this.foo = newFoo;
 *         firePropertyChange(&quot;foo&quot;, old, getFoo());
 *     }
 * 
 *     public String getFoo() {
 *         return foo;
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You will notice that "getFoo()" is used in the setFoo method rather than
 * accessing "foo" directly for the gets. This is done intentionally so that if
 * a subclass overrides getFoo() to return, for instance, a constant value the
 * property change notification system will continue to work properly.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The firePropertyChange method takes into account the old value and the new
 * value. Only if the two differ will it fire a property change event. So you
 * can be assured from the above code fragment that a property change event will
 * only occur if old is indeed different from getFoo()
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>AbstractBean</code> also supports vetoable
 * {@link PropertyChangeEvent} events. These events are similar to
 * <code>PropertyChange</code> events, except a special exception can be used
 * to veto changing the property. For example, perhaps the property is changing
 * from "fred" to "red", but a listener deems that "red" is unexceptable. In
 * this case, the listener can fire a veto exception and the property must
 * remain "fred". For example:
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 *  public class ABean extends AbstractBean {
 *    private String foo;
 *    
 *    public void setFoo(String newFoo) throws PropertyVetoException {
 *      String old = getFoo();
 *      this.foo = newFoo;
 *      fireVetoableChange(&quot;foo&quot;, old, getFoo());
 *    }
 *    public String getFoo() {
 *      return foo;
 *    }
 *  }
 * 
 *  public class Tester {
 *    public static void main(String... args) {
 *      try {
 *        ABean a = new ABean();
 *        a.setFoo(&quot;fred&quot;);
 *        a.addVetoableChangeListener(new VetoableChangeListener() {
 *          public void vetoableChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) throws PropertyVetoException {
 *            if (&quot;red&quot;.equals(evt.getNewValue()) {
 *              throw new PropertyVetoException(&quot;Cannot be red!&quot;, evt);
 *            }
 *          }
 *        }
 *        a.setFoo(&quot;red&quot;);
 *      } catch (Exception e) {
 *        e.printStackTrace(); // this will be executed
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code AbstractBean} is not {@link java.io.Serializable}. Special care must
 * be taken when creating {@code Serializable} subclasses, as the
 * {@code Serializable} listeners will not be saved.  Subclasses will need to 
 * manually save the serializable listeners.  The {@link AbstractSerializableBean}
 * is {@code Serializable} and already handles the listeners correctly.  If 
 * possible, it is recommended that {@code Serializable} beans should extend
 * {@code AbstractSerializableBean}.  If it is not possible, the
 * {@code AbstractSerializableBean} bean implementation provides details on
 * how to correctly serialize an {@code AbstractBean} subclass.
