## Tuner Configurations ##

SDRTrunk allows you to define multiple named tuner configurations per tuner type.  A **Default** configuration is automatically created the first time you use each specific tuner type and will be recreated again if you accidentally delete or rename the **Default** configuration.

SDRTrunk uses the serial number from the E4000 that can be set using the rtl\_eeprom utility, so automatically associate a named tuner configuration with the E4000 dongle, regardless of which USB port is used.

All changes to a named configuration are automatically saved.

## Configuration ##

  * **Frequency** - sets the tuned frequency
  * **Configuration Tab** - controls for changing tuner configuration
  * **Info Tab** - displays information about the tuner

### Configuration Tab ###

  * **Config** - selects a named configuration to use.  Automatically applies the corresponding settings to the tuner
  * **Name** - tuner configuration name.
  * **Correction PPM** - correction value to align the currently tuned frequency with the frequency display values.  Increasing the value causes the frequency display to move to the left and vice-versa.
  * **Sample Rate** - sets the sample rate to use for the tuner.
  * **Master Gain** - sets the overall gain for the tuner and automatically controls the individual gain controls.  Use the **Manual** setting to enable and independently change the LNA, Mixer and Enhance gain controls
  * **LNA Gain** - sets the LNA gain.  Place the Master Gain into **Manual** mode to enable this control.
  * **Mixer Gain** - sets the Mixer gain.  Place the Master Gain into **Manual** mode to enable this control.
  * **Enhance Gain** - sets the Enhance gain.  Place the Master Gain into **Manual** mode to enable this control.
  * **New** - creates a new named tuner configuration
  * **Delete** - deletes the currently listed tuner configuration

### Info Tab ###
The info tab displays information about the tuner:

  * **USB ID** - USB vendor and product identifiers.
  * **Vendor** - vendor name from EEPROM
  * **Product** - product label from EEPROM
  * **Serial** - serial label from EEPROM
  * **IR Enabled** - IR enabled setting from EEPROM
  * **Remote Wake** - remote wake setting from EEPROM
