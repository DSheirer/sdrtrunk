# MacOS Tahoe 26.1 Users - Attention:
Changes to the libusb library for Tahoe version 26.x cause sdrtrunk to fail to launch.  Do the following to install the latest libusb and create a symbolic link and then use the nightly build which includes an updated usb4java native library for Tahoe with ARM processor.

```
brew install libusb
cd /opt
sudo mkdir local
cd local
sudo mkdir lib
cd lib
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/libusb/1.0.29/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib /opt/local/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib
```

## Download the Latest Release
All release versions of sdrtrunk are available from the [releases](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/releases) tab.

* **(final)** These versions have been tested and are the current release version.

## Download Nightly Software Build
The [nightly](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/releases/tag/nightly) release contains current builds of the software 
for all supported operating systems.  This version of the software may contain bugs and may not run correctly.  However, 
it let's you preview the most recent changes and fixes before the next software release.  **Always backup your 
playlist(s) before you use the nightly builds.**  Note: the nightly release is updated each time code changes are 
committed to the code base, so it's not really 'nightly' as much as it is 'current'.

## Minimum System Requirements
* **Operating System:** Windows (~~32 or~~ 64-bit), Linux (~~32 or~~ 64-bit) or Mac (64-bit, 12.x or higher)
* **CPU:** 4-core
* **RAM:** 8GB or more (preferred).  Depending on usage, 4GB may be sufficient.
