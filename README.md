* **(beta)** These versions are currently being tested for bugs and functionality prior to final release.
* **(final)** These versions have been tested and are the current release version.

## Unzip the release

## Optional - P25 Audio
If you're using sdrtrunk with a P25 trunked radio system, the [JMBE](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/wiki/JMBE) wiki page contains instructions for downloading the JMBE audio library source code and compiling the JMBE library.  Once you have compiled the library, launch the sdrtrunk application.  From the menu bar, choose **View >> Preferences**.  In the **JMBE Audio Codec** section, update the path to where your compiled JMBE library is located.  Any channels that are started after you set the path will be able to produce P25 audio.
