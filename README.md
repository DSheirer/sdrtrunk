## Download Nightly Software Build
The [nightly](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/releases/tag/nightly) release contains current builds of the software 
for all supported operating systems.  This version of the software may contain bugs and may not run correctly.  However, 
it let's you preview the most recent changes and fixes before the next software release.  **Always backup your 
playlist(s) before you use the nightly builds.**  Note: the nightly release is updated each time code changes are 
committed to the code base, so it's not really 'nightly' as much as it is 'current'.

* **CPU:** 4-core
